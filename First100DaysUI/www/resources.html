        <h3>Why does my child need a diagnosis of autism?</h3>

        <p>
            <em>You may wonder: why does my child need a diagnosis of autism? That&apos;s a fair question to ask &mdash;
                especially when no one is able to offer you a cure.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            A thorough and detailed diagnosis provides important information about your child&apos;s behavior and
            development. It can help create a roadmap for treatment by identifying your child&apos;s specific strengths
            and challenges and providing useful information about which needs and skills should be targeted for
            effective intervention. A diagnosis is often required to access autism-specific services through early
            intervention programs or your local school district.
        </p>

        <h3>How is autism diagnosed?</h3>

        <p>
            Presently, there is not a medical test for autism a diagnosis is based on observed behavior and educational
            and psychological testing. As the symptoms of autism vary, so do the routes to obtaining a diagnosis. You
            may have raised questions with your pediatrician. Some children are identified as having developmental
            delays before obtaining a diagnosis of autism and may already receive some early intervention or special
            education services. Unfortunately, parents&apos; concerns are sometimes not taken seriously by their doctor
            and a diagnosis is delayed. Autism Speaks and other autism-related organizations are working hard to educate
            parents and physicians, so that children with autism are identified as early as possible.
        </p>
        <p>From birth to
            at least 36 months of age, every child should be screened for developmental milestones during routine
            visits. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for autism at their 18-
            and 24-month well-baby checkups. If concerns about a child&apos;s development are raised, his or her doctor
            should refer the child to Early Intervention and a specialist for a developmental evaluation. Lead exposure
            and hearing screenings should also be performed. Following the results, your child may be referred to a
            specialist, usually a <strong>Developmental Pediatrician</strong>, a <strong>Neurologist</strong>, a
            <strong>Psychiatrist</strong> or a <strong>Psychologist</strong>, for further evaluation. The team of
            specialists that evaluate your child&apos;s condition may also include an Audiologist, to rule out hearing
            loss, a <strong>Speech & Language Therapist</strong>, to determine language skills and needs, and an
            <strong>Occupational Therapist</strong> to evaluate physical and motor skills.<br/>A multi-disciplinary
            evaluation is important for diagnosing autism and other challenges that often accompany autism, such as
            delays in motor skills. If your child has not been evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team, you will want to
            make sure further evaluations are conducted so that you can learn as much as possible about your child&apos;s
            individual strengths and needs. For more information you can visit the Autism Treatment Network.
